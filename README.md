# ExhibitPowerBI

## Overview

Power BI is Microsoft's version of a BI visualization tool. Within the Power BI ecosystem, there is a Desktop application and Service (web-based) interface which allows for loading, modeling, and visualizing data. Although, the two applications can be used to completed the same task, there are data scenarios best suited for Desktop, and capabilities/features best leveraged in Service. We will explore several different data scenarios and features around Power BI, as well as take a look at many different quirks in the environment.
